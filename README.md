# SpaceDancers

**This is an unfinished project and probably will stay like this unless someone wants to fork this project and keep building it.**

## Description

The idea was to make an own version of the classic game Space Invaders with the core difference that the invaders would move in rhythm of the music playing.
Users would have the option to use own music.

This project was written in c++ using the SFML library.
